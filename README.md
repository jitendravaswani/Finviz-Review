## Can Finviz Help You Track Your Investments?

Finviz isn’t just for finding stocks—it’s also great for managing them. You can create portfolios to watch your investments, whether you’re new or experienced.

The free plan lets you track a few portfolios, while the Elite plan allows up to 100 portfolios with 100 stocks each. 

You can group stocks, like “growth stocks” or “dividend stocks,” and check how they’re doing over time.

With the Elite plan, you get alerts when stocks hit certain prices and more detailed data for better analysis.

## How Well Does Finviz Work?

Finviz is great for most traders, especially those who don’t need super-fast updates. The Elite plan’s live data is perfect for traders who make moves during the day.

However, day traders might find the data too slow, and the backtesting tool isn’t very advanced. It’s good but not the best for serious strategy testing.

Tracking Futures, Forex, and Crypto

### Finviz Also Covers:

Futures: See data for things like oil or gold (delayed by 20 minutes).

Forex: Check currency pairs like USD/EUR.

Crypto: Follow coins like Bitcoin (live data for Elite users).

It’s not the deepest tool for these markets, but it’s a good starting point.

## Final Thoughts

Finviz is an easy-to-use tool for tracking and finding stocks. 

The free version is awesome for beginners, and the Elite plan is great for traders who want live data.

It’s not the most advanced tool, but it’s reliable and does the job well. Ready to trade smarter? Give Finviz a try!
